## The ablisk module

**xplendid** runs on top of **[ablisk](https://pypi.org/project/ablisk/)**, a Python module for designing, analysing, and making recommendations on A/B tests. Both xplendid and ablisk are heavily inspired by [Evan Miller's work](https://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/sample-size.html) on A/B testing and sample size calculations.

If you want to run A/B tests directly in Python without using xplendid, you can install ablisk via pip:

```bash
pip install ablisk
```
