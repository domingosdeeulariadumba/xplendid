## The `ablisk` Module

**xplendid** has **[ablisk](https://pypi.org/project/ablisk/)** as its statistical engine, a Python module for A/B tests. Both **xplendid** and **ablisk** are heavily inspired by [Evan Miller's work](https://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/sample-size.html) on A/B testing and sample size calculations.

If you want to run A/B tests directly in Python without using **xplendid**, you can install **ablisk** via pip:

```bash
pip install ablisk
